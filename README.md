### Pyraminx

#### Method Used:
My method uses Noah Richardson's method from his tutorial as a base, but also includes other algorithms that I have learned. The first step of my method is almost identical to the one shown in the video, as I start by matching three center pieces and solving one side of the pyraminx. After this step, I always like to solve any corner piece, as this step is the simplest and grants me time to inspect the cube while turning them. The next part of my method differs from the tutorial video as I like to split this part into three different cases which I categorized myself. The first case involves finding any side with two unsolved edge pieces, where those pieces also have the wrong face colour compared to the center pieces. I  then use the basic solving method to finish the solve. The next case involves finding an almost solved pyraminx with two pieces that are in the right spot but flipped in their position. This case simply requires me to swap these two pieces before using the basic method. The last case involves finding 3 center pieces on the top of the pyraminx that are mot aligned with thier respective edge pieces. This case requires a special three-step algotithm which then completes the solve.

### 3x3

#### Method Used:
My method for the 3x3 is still being modified as I continue to improve, but consists of a variety of concepts and algorithms that I've learned from several sources. I begin by intuitively creating a cross on the white side, as this is the first step used by the majority of methods. After this step, I use the basic f2l algorithms demonstrated in J Perm's intuitive f2l method. However, I've also learned a few algorithms from J Perm's advanced f2l guide to solve harder cases in fewer turns. Also, one extra yet very helpful algorithm that I've implemented in my method is the 'sexy move' from BrodytheCuber's video, "How To Be Sub 20 On 3x3 | A Complete Guide". When combined, these algorithms allow me to solve any f2l case in a healthy amount of time. However, this step contains a plethora of cases, and I am still learning new algorithms to improve my time. The next part of my method was derived from Ethan Garvey's "How to Solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube: Easiest Tutorial (Last Layer)", which consists of the simplest way to perform the OLL and PLL steps commonly used in 3x3 solves. This is currently the method I use to solve the 3x3, but it will continue to develop.
